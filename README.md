# IA103  

This repo contains my answers and work for **IA103**.
The organization is done by **class** (eg: `c12`, `c14`), then by type of work (eg: `TD`), and lastly by the
number of the "TD"

## 🗂️ Organization

- Each **class** has it own folder (`c14`, `c12`).  
- Inside each, a folder `TD` containing all the Exercises.  
- Each **TD** has a number (`1`, `2`, …) and contains :  
  - `answers/` → my answers in markdown (`.md`).  
    - My answers include text and code (in Markdown Code Blocks) and integrated images.  
  - `original/` → Original file(s) given by the trainer (statement, instructions, etc...).

## 🎯 Objective  

- Centralize and organize my solutions of lessons and exercises.
- Allow direct reading on GitHub.
- Facilitate the revision and sharing with my collegues.
